# Binary Classification of Amazon Product Ratings
In this project, I used product reviews from Amazon to perform binary classification, where the goal is to identify if the review text represents a high-star review or a low-star review. For the purposes of this project, I define a high-star review as one with a score > 3 (i.e. a 4 or 5 star review), with low-star reviews being <= 3 (i.e. 1,2,3 star reviews).

For the first part, I built three binary classification models based on review text only. The three models were Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, and Perceptron. I used functions in scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas.

For the second part,

For the third part,

I evaluated all the models throughout this project using confusion matrix, ROC AUC score, accuracy score, and F1 score. Please look at the project write up, the pdf file uploaded in this repository, for a deep dive into this project description, processing, analysis, and results.
